# school_management

Simple School Management System. 
We have used JAVA as the programming language and for database we have used MySQL via WAMP server.
We have included the DB scripts so that you can simply install the database schema with the sample data. So, that you can have a hands on experience.
This project has four major managements 
  1. Student Management.
  2. Staff Management.
  3. Library Management.
  4. Event Management.
  
This project has been implemented for our third year module CSSE. A group of four members knows has Team Extreme has came up with this simple solution for a school.
You may need to install Netbeans, MySQL database server and Java JDK to run this simple system.
